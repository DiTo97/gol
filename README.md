# Game of Life

Comparative analysis of possible parallel implementations of Conway's famous [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) (GoL) using both GPU-based toolkits, CUDA, and CPU-based toolkits, OpenMP and MPI, on INFN's [Ocapie cluster](https://web.ge.infn.it/calcolo/joomla/2-uncategorised/106-farm-hpc-ocapie) for HPC.

**Authors**: F. Minutoli, M. Ghirardelli, and D. Surpanu.

## Useful information

### Standard

- The borderline size to distinguish a small GoL's grid from a big one has been set to *50*x*50* due to visualization constraints. Indeed any grid larger than that cannot be properly visualized in a terminal and its evolution would not be appreciated in its entirety.

- Any custom C *guard* implemented to force some specific behaviour in the code is marked with a `GoL_` prefix.

### Display file format

Both the input and output file format comply with the full-matrix format (FM), that is:

- A single header row comprising the grid dimensions, as two space-separated numbers expressing the # of rows and columns.
  
- A line for each row in the grid comprising all the values in it, expressed as an *X* for ALIVE cells and an empty space for DEAD ones.

Sample input files can be found in the `example` folder, but one is given here, as well:

```console
4 4
X  X
    
  XX
 X X
```

In case the (0, 0) cell is DEAD, thus the file starts with an empty space, replace its character with any non-*X* character (i.e., *A*) of choice before reading the GoL matrix from file. This prevents a well-known buggy behaviour of the [`getline()`](https://c-for-dummies.com/blog/?p=1112) function in C, due to which leading whitespaces are skipped.

### Folder structure

This repository contains both the source code for a GPU-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life, inside the `src\gpu` folder and for a CPU-based implementation, inside the `src\cpu` folder. The `include` folder, instead, contains header files that both implementations utilize interchangeably, with a few specific C *guards* whenever the functionalities have to differ.

The `bin` folder contains various binaries generated by both implementations, characterized by specific tags in their names that describe their role:

- `vec`, stands for binaries optimized with vectorization at compile time;
- `omp`, stands for binaries in which OpenMP support has been enabled;
- `mpi`, stands for binaries in which MPI support has been enabled, thus they should be launched with either `mpirun` or `mpiexec` commands;
- `hybrid`, stands for binaries in which a hybrid MPI+OpenMP support has been enabled;
- `cuda`, stands for binaries that should be run on a GPU-capable machine.

Last but not least, the `experiment` folder contains all the experiments that we ran both implementations through.

Despite the repo containing both CPU and GPU code it has to be said that in order for the whole code to run, it needs to be shipped on a GPU-capable machine with OpenMP and MPI support. Otherwise, specific machines that provide either CPU or GPU capabilities should be implied to test both worlds separately.

### Sample usage

Run any binary with the `-h` flag to learn the expected usage.
